# *Storm of Lights*
A 2d side scrolling action game inspired by the Castlevania franchise.  
 
For now the game will be singleplayer and will run on a client developed in C++ though there is future plans to implement multiplayer functionality.

The graphics API I will be using is OpenGL and due to the configurations unfortunately this game will only be compatible with Windows.

The most notable Castlevania games that inspired this project are the following:

[Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Aria_of_Sorrow)  
[Castlevania - Dawn of Sorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Dawn_of_Sorrow)  
[Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Order_of_Ecclesia)
